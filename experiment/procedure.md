### Procedure

<div>
  <h2>Steam Distillation:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The organic mixture together with some water is placed in an R.B flask which is then connected to a steam generator on one side & a water condenser on the other.</li>
    <li>Heat the mixture to avoid the condensation of steam in it.</li>
    <li>The water in the flask is heated & then a current of steam is passed into the mixture.</li>
    <li>Ortho nitro phenol is steam volatile, so it readily passes over in the steam.</li>
    <li>The vapour of the compound along with steam leaves the flask from the outlet & gets condensed in the water condenser.</li>
    <li>It is then collected in a conical flask containing ice to solidify the liquid.</li>
    <li>Pure o-nitro phenol is filtered at the Buchner funnel and the residue in the distillation flask contains p-nitro phenol.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Points to Remember while Performing the Experiment in a Real Laboratory:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always wear a lab coat and gloves when you are in the lab. Switch on the exhaust fan upon entering.</li>
    <li>Ensure all required chemicals and reagents are available; if not, prepare them accordingly.</li>
    <li>Adjust the Bunsen burner flame properly — a small blue cone is ideal.</li>
    <li>Clean all apparatus with chromic acid and distilled water. Ensure they are free from water droplets.</li>
    <li>Calibrate the electronic weighing balance before measurements.</li>
    <li>Ensure the desiccator contains sufficient desiccant (e.g., silica gel).</li>
    <li>Clean the crucible with chromic acid, heat it, and cool it before placing in the desiccator. Use tongs or tissue — never touch with bare hands.</li>
    <li>Set the hot air oven to 130°C and handle with cotton gloves.</li>
    <li>Clean Kipp’s apparatus tubes and ensure they are loaded with solid material (iron sulfide) and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for producing H<sub>2</sub>S gas.</li>
    <li>Clean all glassware with soap and distilled water. Recap reagent bottles after use.</li>
    <li>Before leaving the lab, turn off the lights, exhaust fan, oven, and gas cylinder.</li>
    <li>Dispose of used gloves in the appropriate waste bin.</li>
  </ul>
