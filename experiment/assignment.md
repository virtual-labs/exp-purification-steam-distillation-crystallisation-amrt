<ol>
  <li>
    <p>When a mixture of o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol is subjected to steam distillation, the ortho isomer distills at 93°C but the para isomer does not. Explain it.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>For what reason are compounds boiling below 100°C not subjected to steam distillation?</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Consider a liquid X of molar mass 98 g/mol that distills in steam. At the boiling point, the partial pressures of the two liquids X and water are 5.32×10³ Nm⁻² and 9.44×10⁴ Nm⁻² respectively. Calculate the percentage by mass of X in the distillate.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>During the process of steam distillation, steam is generated outside the flask containing the mixture to be distilled and not inside it. Explain why.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages of steam distillation as a method of purification.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
