      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Immiscible liquids do not mix to form a homogeneous solution.",
        "b": "Flammability is unrelated to miscibility.",
        "c": "Solubility refers to solutes, not mixing of liquids.",
        "d": "Miscible means the liquids mix, which is the opposite of the question."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Steam distillation allows separation below the decomposition temperature.",
        "b": "Fractional distillation is used for miscible liquids with close boiling points.",
        "c": "Not a valid answer.",
