      "question": "If one compares compound A composed of non polar molecules with compound B composed of polar molecules, and both molecules have the same molecular formula then it is true that:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Both compounds have the same boiling point",
        "b": "B will not boil",
        "c": "B boils at a lower temperature than A",
        "d": "A boils at a lower temperature than B"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Polarity affects boiling point.",
        "b": "Incorrect. All liquids boil at some temperature.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Polar molecules usually have higher boiling points.",
        "d": "Correct. Non-polar A boils at a lower temperature than polar B."

      "question": "For which of the following mixtures would steam distillation be the most appropriate method of separation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Carbon tetra chloride & Toluene",
        "b": "Benzene & Toluene",
        "c": "Aniline & Water",
        "d": "Methanol & Water"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. These are miscible and non-decomposing.",
        "b": "Incorrect. These are miscible and have close boiling points.",
        "c": "Correct. Aniline is steam distillable and immiscible with water.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Methanol and water form an azeotrope, not suitable for steam distillation."

      "question": "In the distillation apparatus shown, what are the parts labeled A & B?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A = Funnel, B = Thermometer",
        "b": "A = Liebig condenser, B = Flask",
        "c": "A = Liebig condenser, B = Thermometer",
        "d": "A = Thermometer, B = Funnel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect pairing of components.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The condenser is not directly labeled with the flask.",
        "c": "Correct. Common labeling in apparatus setups.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Thermometer is not labeled as A typically."
